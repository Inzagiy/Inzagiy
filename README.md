## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
# ðŸ”§ Hi, Iâ€™m Philipp

Iâ€™m just starting out in **Site Reliability Engineering** â€” learning Linux basics, Docker, and monitoring tools.

Practicing with personal projects: setting up NGINX, writing simple bash scripts, exploring Prometheus + Grafana.

Next goal: contribute to open-source infra docs!
